Create an "Ishop" project (online store) in the ishop folder.
Set the list of products in an online store as an array; for each product, at least the name, price, URL of the photo, and how many units of the product are left in the warehouse should be stored.
Write a React component that displays a table with this list of products. The component should receive the name of the store and an array of products via props.
Set types for props of the component.
When developing a component, make the most of forEach and other array processing methods.
