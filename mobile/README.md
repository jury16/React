Based on the Mobile examples, develop a new Mobile project in the Mobile folder.

Implement buttons for adding, deleting, changing names and balances of clients. When working with form fields, use references (ref) rather than bi-directional binding (onChange + setState).

Do not use callbacks (for making changes to the list of clients), use EventEmitter.

Implement buttons to filter all blocked active clients.

Use PureComponent only, log all render calls to the console.

The "client" component should receive exactly the link to the hash with information about the client, and not the client's details separately.

Provide data immutability with native JavaScript or with any package of your choice.
