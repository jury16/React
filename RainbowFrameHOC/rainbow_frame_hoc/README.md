Based on the RainbowFrame project, develop a new RainbowFrameHOC project in the RainbowFrameHOC folder.
The ability to wrap a component in multiple colored frames must be implemented as a HOC withRainbowFrame. 
The colors of the frames are specified by an array of colors. 
The content inside the frames should be the content that is nested in the wrapping tag.
