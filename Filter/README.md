Create a Filter project in the Filter folder.</br>
An array of strings is passed to the props component. It displays them as a vertical scrolling list.</br>
Above the list, a text input field, a checkbox and a reset button are displayed.</br>
When you enter text in a field, only those lines that contain the entered text remain in the list.</br>
When the checkboxes are installed, the lines are displayed in alphabetical order, when unchecked, they are displayed in the same order in which they are located in the array.</br>
When the "reset" button is pressed, the state of the checkbox and the text field is reset, the list returns to its original state.</br>
