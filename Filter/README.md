Create a Filter project in the Filter folder.
An array of strings is passed to the props component. It displays them as a vertical scrolling list.
Above the list, a text input field, a checkbox and a reset button are displayed.
When you enter text in a field, only those lines that contain the entered text remain in the list.
When the checkboxes are installed, the lines are displayed in alphabetical order, when unchecked, they are displayed in the same order in which they are located in the array.
When the "reset" button is pressed, the state of the bird and the text field is reset, the list returns to its original state.
